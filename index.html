        I'm Quint Turner. As you can see by my selfie on the left, I love penguins. But I also love other things. When I'm not writing code, I'm probably writing comedic blog posts, playing video games, or watching sports. If you move on over to my portfolio page, you'll find a few links to places you can find what I've written. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The first such link is to my Twitter page. I mostly lurk my friends' posts and tweet about three times a month if I'm feeling real creative. I recommend everyone to use Twitter this way rather than as a news source as it is way better when used small-scale. To the right of it is a link to my LinkedIn. I have no idea what to do on there. You can't just post jokes on LinkedIn, so it's a real mystery to me. Below that is a link to my Clippings.me writing portfolio where I've selected some of my best work as a sports journalist, data trends writer, and comedy blogger. Of course, none of my fans (both of whom are my parents) can truly decide what is my best work, so if you have a suggestion as to what to put there, please send me a message on my Contact page. Whenever that works. Next to that is a link to my blog. I've had it up for 10 years. Do not ask where the first nine and a half years of content went. Below that and to the left is a link to my book that I wrote when I was 17. I've never read it so I don't know if it's good or not. Right next to my book is a link to GymBro, an application that I helped build during the Boot Camp. I was the project manager and came up with the UI and outlined the logic of the app, though my team did most of the actual coding.

    <!--Similar to the Navbar, I placed the footer outside of the container so that I could play with its positioning and look without messing with the container. I am curious about how much "copyright" I do have on this website. Since a lot of it was copy-pasted code from Bootstrap, I can't have copyright on that, but do I have copyright on, say, the paragraph about me? And what sort of protections do I even have on that? Could I get millions of dollars suing someone for copying that content? Just interests me.-->
    <footer><p>Copyright</p></footer>

  <!--The links to all the external Bootstrap Javascript code so all the copy-pasted code works properly-->
